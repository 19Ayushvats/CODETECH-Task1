## Overview of the Project

### Project : Exploratory Data analysis on Health Disease Dataset

### Objective : 
The primary objective of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the health disease dataset by identifying key patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. This involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, performing descriptive statistics, and visualizing critical insights to uncover factors that may influence the prevalence and severity of health diseases. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can inform healthcare professionals and policymakers in making data-driven decisions to improve patient outcomes and public health strategies.

### Key activities
**Data Collection and Understanding:** Collected the health disease dataset from a reliable source. Understood the dataset's structure, including the number of rows, columns, and data types.
**Visualizations:** Created visualizations to communicate findings effectively
**Correlation Analysis:**Computed the correlation coefficients to identify relationships between numerical features. Visualized correlations using a heatmap to identify strong positive or negative correlations.

### Technologies Used
**Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis.
**Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing results.
**Pandas:** A library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.
**NumPy:** A library for numerical computations, which provides support for arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
**Matplotlib:** A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
**Seaborn:** A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
